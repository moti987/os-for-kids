<p id="description">
  <strong>OS for Kids</strong> is an educational project designed to simulate and visualize various operating system concepts tailored for a younger audience. It provides an interactive and engaging platform to learn about process scheduling, memory allocation, deadlock detection, and sorting algorithms. The project uses modern web technologies, including React and TypeScript, to deliver a responsive and user-friendly experience.

<h2>Modules</h2>
<ol>
  <li>
    <h3>Deadlock Detection</h3>
    <p>Detect potential deadlocks in a simulated environment using Banker's Algorithm. Visualize the state of the system through resource allocation graphs.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <h3>Memory Allocation Simulator</h3>
    <p>Explore memory allocation techniques with strategies like Best Fit, First Fit, Worst Fit, and Next Fit. Visualize memory usage and fragmentation.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <h3>Sorting Visualizer</h3>
    <p>Understand sorting concepts with algorithms such as Parallel Quick Sort, Merge Sort, and Bucket Sort. Adjustable speed and size make it interactive and educational.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <h3>Process Scheduler Visualizer</h3>
    <p>Visualize scheduling techniques like FCFS, SJF, Priority Scheduling, and Round Robin. Features Gantt chart visualizations for better understanding.</p>
  </li>
